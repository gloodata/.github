## Everything you need to develop your AI-Native applications

**Create your extension**:  Add a single HTTP endpoint and implement the required handlers.

**Connect data & logic**: Expose your databases, APIs and microservices as tools, resources and data types.

**Register your extension**: Let Gloodata know where your extension is.

**Try & iterate**: Test and improve your extension in a tight feedback loop.
